## What is PostgreSQL?

**PostgreSQL** is an advanced open-source **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** that supports both traditional relational queries and modern data types like JSON, arrays, and custom objects. It is widely known for:

- **ACID compliance** and data integrity
- **High scalability** for large datasets
- **Extensibility** with custom functions and types
- **Support for indexing, triggers, views, and stored procedures**
- **Role-based security and permissions**

This makes PostgreSQL ideal for use in real-world enterprise applications, such as those developed in the Finacle platform.
